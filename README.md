Hello! And welcome to my capstone presentation.  

My name is Teófilo Percy. I am pleased to complete this Data Science Certification with this capstone presentation. I will apply my data science skills as a Data scientist for a private space launch company in this final capstone project.

As a starting point of almost all data science projects, I will collect as much relevant data as possible. I will be collecting data from various sources using both API and Web Scraping. After this raw data has been collected, I will improve the quality of the data by performing data wrangling.

Then I will start exploring the processed data (I will explore some really interesting real-world datasets). I will use my SQL skills to query the data and gather insights.

I will gain further insights into the data by applying some basic statistical analysis and data visualization. We will see directly how variables might be related to each other.

I will drill down into finer levels of detail by splitting the data into groups defined by categorical variables or factors in the data.  

I will build, evaluate, and refine predictive models for discovering more exciting insights. 

This presentation is the final task of this capstone project. I will be developing stories of all my analysis.

Thanks!
